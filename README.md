# ðŸŒŒ ShiftWalker â€“ A 2D Puzzle Platformer

**ShiftWalker** is a 2D side-scrolling puzzle platformer built with Unity 2022.3.6f1, where players can **shift between two parallel worlds** to navigate through increasingly complex levels. The core mechanic explores the theme "**One Mechanic, Many Worlds**".

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay

- Shift between World A and World B to bypass obstacles, avoid traps, and solve puzzles.
- Features classic platforming elements: movement, double jump, pressure plates, moving platforms, and hazards.
- Each world has different physical properties (e.g., gravity, visibility, platform layouts).
- The player must think strategically and shift at the right time to progress.

## ðŸ“– Story

You play as a mysterious test subject chosen by **Koko**, who grants you the power to shift worlds to retrieve a legendary diamond.

In **Chapter 2**, you must escape Kokoâ€™s simulation and reclaim your freedom.
